# go-excersize

This is a practice excersize for go projects.
The codebase implements a REST API with two endpoints.
Sending a POST request with a string in its body to the /message route will return a json containing the same message without vowels.
Sending a GET request to the /count route will return a json with the number of messages recieved.
